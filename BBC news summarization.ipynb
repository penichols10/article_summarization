    "# Generating Abstractive Summaries by Fine-Tuning T5\n",
    "The possible uses for automatic text summarization are innumerable. Many texts are long, and for various reasons we would prefer not to read a text or would like to know what a text is about before it is used. What is less obvious is that there are two types of automatically generated summaries: extractive and extractive. An extractive summary is one which consists of extracts from some text, and in that sense it is not really not automatically generated but found. An extractive summary model may take in a question, then predict the first and last index of text in some document to use as a summary. Put otherwise, it generates probability distributions over the length of some article for the start and end index, and takes the argmax of each to find the indices. This is a fairly standard task, but it limits the model to using as summaries already existing text. An abstractive summary is one using language generated by a model. It may generate probability distributions over sequences of texts to give an idea of what word should come next in a sequence. The next token can then be selected using methods discussed below. This is a more challenging task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put the problem as simply as possible, natural language problems are computationally intensive, and they become moreso as input sequences increase in length. They are also data-hungry. Natural language generation is also difficult, and it becomes more difficult as the length of output sequences increase. The problem gets worse considering recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks struggle to learn long sequences, even LSTMs. Recurrent neural networks also update a hidden state in a sequential fashion, meaning they cannot be parallelized. All of the information from the sequence is ultimately contained in the hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, a T5 model will be fine tuned to generate summaries based off of BBC problems. This method addresses all of the problems above. Abstract summarization remains computationally intensive and data hungry, but the T5 model used is pre-trained and has been trained on a large amount of data and for a large amount of time. That means that fine-tuning time is relatively very short and leads to a model that is superior to what can reasonably be trained on a consumer computer. A superior model means superior text generation. Additionally, T5 uses transformers. The crucial point of the transformer is that it uses attention. In an encoder-decoder model, attention at each timestep looks over all of the encoder timesteps - rather than just a final hidden state, generates a probability distribution and uses this to generate scores. Attention ultimately quantify which part of the encoder sequence is most relevant to each part of the decoder sequence. The bottom line is that attention not only greatly improves performance with respect to predictions but is also parallelizable, improving performance with respect to computation time."

Each text is first tokenized, that is, broken down into numeric parts. Each token is then converted to a corresponding number. These sequences of numbers are the input ids. As discussed above, the texts will be padded to the same length. The \"padding\" consists of padding tokens. These tokens do not contain any meaning by definition. As such, the model should not consider them when calculating attention scores on articles, since attention scores highlight important features in the text. To ensure the model ignores padding tokens, attention masks are generated to identify which tokens are padding tokens. The result is that each text, will be converted to a sequence of integers, the input ids, and the articles will also be given attention masks."

    "The trained model is ready to generate text. Inputs to the model need to be prepared exactly the same way as the training articles, which is to say, they need to be cleaned and encoded the same way. Then, they are ready to be put into the model. The model then generates a summary for each article using a beam search.\n",

    "A beam search is best understood by contrasting it to a simple greedy search. A greedy algorithm is one that chooses the best option at each time step, without any regard for the bigger picture. So generating text in the simplest greedy fashion means choosing the next most likely token given the tokens made so far. This, however, will not necessarily mean generating the most optimal sequence overall. Additionally, it can also lead to repeating sequences of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beam search seeks to address this problem without searching through every possible sequence of text. A beam search with beam size k - essentially the number of sequences to consider at each step - proceeeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate a probability distribution over the vocabulary with some initialization token.\n",
    "2. Select the k highest probability tokens.\n",
    "3. For each of those k tokens, generate a probability distribution over the vocabulary.\n",
    "4. Out of all of the possible sequences (a total of k * the number of tokens in the vocabulary), choose the k with the highest probability.\n",
    "5. Repeat in a similar fashion, finding the k most likely sequences, until some end condition is met, ex. an end token is generated or a maximum length is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation used below additionally allows the model to prevent the repetition of n-grams of a certain size or above from being repeated within a sumamry.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm allows a number of sequences to be explored and prevents characters from being repeated while requiring far less computational power than an exhaustive search. However, as with any algorithm that generates text in a probablistic fashion, it is really only an approximation of how natural languages is actually generated."

    "# Evaluation\n",
    "The models are evaluated using the ROUGE score. ROUGE scores essentially measure the overlap between two sequences of text, here, reference and generated summaries. Here, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-N scores are used. These can be defined simultaneously by considering the ROUGE-N score, which is the ROUGE score considering N grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROUGE-N score quantifies the number of N-grams found in both the reference and generated summaries. The score is calculated for each reference/generated pair. Really it consists of three scores, the precision, recall, and f-score, each of which corresponds to its more traditional classification analogue. Specifically, these are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{ROUGE-N Precision} = \\dfrac{\\text{N-grams co-occuring in ground truth and generated summaries}}{\\text{total N-grams in the generated summary}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{ROUGE-N Recall} = \\dfrac{\\text{N-grams co-occuring in ground truth and generated summaries}}{\\text{total N-grams in the ground truth summary}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Put more conceptually, the precision reports the fraction of n-grams from the generated summary that are also in the ground truth summary, and the recall reports the fraction of n-grams from the ground truth summary that were predicted by the model. The f-score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 are simply the scores where the n-grams are unigrams or bigrams - or single words and pairs for words, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE-L is slightly different. The \"L\" stands for \"longest common subsequence,\" which is simply the length of the longest identical consecutive sequences of text in each text. This number is divided by the unigrams in the generated or ground truth summaries, depending on whether the precision or recall is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for each score, the model returns a low, mid, and high score. Recall that ROUGE calculates scores for each pair of generated and ground truth summaries, then aggregates them. The mid score is the mean score. The low and high scores represent the lower and upper bounds for a 95% confidence interval, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE scores, as many NLP metrics, are imperfect. There are three notable limitations. First, it considers common words, not similarity of meaning. So \"Apple's stock fell this quarter\" will take a score penalty if the reference summary is \"The company's stock fell this quarter,\" even if the former conveys the meaning of an article better. Potential ways to mitigate this include stemming and lemmatizing. Here, stemming is used, which reduces a word to its stem, such as \"running\" to \"run\" or \"painted\" to \"paint.\" Second, the score does not measure the coherence of the output, just commonly found n-grams. This is addressed by looking at longer n-grams or the ROUGE-L score. However, longer n-grams are generally less likely to be predicted. Third, the metrics do not check for the substantive accuracy of the summary, that is, they do not directly convey whether the summary accurately conveys the messaage of the text."

This could potentially come down to differences in length between generated and reference summary length since. Additionally, the model's ability to generate useful summaries is superior when looking at unigrams rather than sequences of other lengths. This is an intuitively reasonable result, given generating any one word is probably more likely than generating any sequence of more than one word. Finally, none of the summaries in the test set is far superior or far inferior to any other, which is a desirable result."
